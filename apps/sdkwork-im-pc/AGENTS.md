# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this application root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Resolve this standards root once and use it as the global authority for the current task:

- `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`

Read only the relevant README task-matrix row or navigation heading, then load the selected authority sections.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this application root:

- `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this application root. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` for PC identity, SDK/API inventory, release metadata, packaging, or app-owned capabilities. Read `etc/` for renderer runtime bindings and the parent deployment reference; concrete public domains remain owned by the IM root `etc/`.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: local application agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: PC application identity and release metadata.
- `.sdkwork/`: application dictionary for local skills, plugins, manifests, and AI workspace metadata.
- `specs/`: local PC application/component contracts and narrowing rules.
- `packages/`: PC React package family for app, console, admin, shared runtime, and desktop host modules.
- `src/`: thin PC application bootstrap, providers, route assembly, and shell entry.
- `scripts/`: app-local build, validation, generation, migration, and development utilities.
- `package.json`: app-surface command manifest; public command names still follow `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`.

## Spec Resolution Order


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task: resolve the selected root and task category before reading broad source context.

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` routing material and classify the owned surface.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json`, module `specs/`, repository/application `specs/`, and `.sdkwork/` only when the task reaches the contract each item governs.
3. Locate only the relevant task-matrix row or navigation heading in `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`; do not load the full catalog.
4. Read only the task-specific global spec sections selected by that route, then inspect implementation files.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, or package identity is touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when local contracts are relevant.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` only when local agent extensions are relevant.
5. Read `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the relevant standards are clear.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, and `../../../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../../../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, and `../../../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- TypeScript/Node code: `../../../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`.
- Frontend/UI code: `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/UI_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`, and `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_PC_REACT_UI_SPEC.md`.
- PC application architecture: `../../../sdkwork-specs/APPLICATION_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_SPEC.md`, and `../../../sdkwork-specs/APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`.
- Runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, and packaging changes must follow the task matrix in `../../../sdkwork-specs/README.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load unrelated specs for unrelated tasks.

## PC Package Naming

Canonical console/admin package naming in this app root:

- Console surface: `sdkwork-im-console-*`
- Admin surface: `sdkwork-im-admin-*`
- Normalized PC targets per `APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`: `sdkwork-im-pc-console-*`, `sdkwork-im-pc-admin-*`
- PC-native capabilities: `sdkwork-im-pc-*`

Historical `sdkwork-clawchat-*` names were retired and must not be reintroduced.

## Group Knowledgebase Boundary

- The chat surface reads authoritative current membership through the generated IM SDK. Only the current group Owner can initialize or retry a group Knowledgebase; after activation, joined non-Guest Owners, Admins, and Members can open it.
- The Header is the launch affordance and group information exposes the Owner management entry. Browser launch uses only an opaque ticket in the standalone Knowledgebase route fragment; desktop launch sends only that ticket to the registered deep link for the independent Knowledgebase Tauri process.
- Feature packages use generated SDKs or approved composed facades only. They must not construct raw Knowledgebase HTTP requests, manual credentials, space identifiers, destination URLs, or embedded Knowledgebase Webviews.

## Code Style Rules

Read `../../../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../../../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Root `src/` must stay thin; business pages, services, i18n, state, and route contributions belong in packages. Feature packages use generated SDK clients or approved composed wrappers, not raw HTTP or manual credential headers.

Dev-server startup scripts in this app root invoke cross-repository builds of sibling `sdkwork-ui/sdkwork-ui-pc-react`. Those scripts must verify build-critical source files in the sibling workspace before invoking `pnpm build`, and self-heal missing git-tracked source files from git per `CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` §7.

## Build, Test, and Verification


<!-- SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->
Choose only the narrowest verification selected by the changed surface. This is not a default full-suite command list.
Run workspace-wide checks only when the change crosses that boundary.
`bootstrap-*`, `align-*`, `sync-*`, `--write`, and other mutating repair commands are not verification defaults; use them only for an explicitly scoped repair, migration, bootstrap, or alignment task and inspect the resulting diff.
<!-- /SDKWORK-VERIFICATION-ROUTING: v1 -->

Run commands from this application root unless a command explicitly targets the repository root:

- `pnpm dev`
- `pnpm dev:desktop`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test:domain-app-sdk-auth-runtime`
- `pnpm test:notary-app-sdk-integration`
- `pnpm test:drive-app-sdk-integration`
- `pnpm test:knowledgebase-app-sdk-integration`
- `pnpm test:voice-app-sdk-integration`
- `pnpm test:qr-scan-standard`

From the repository root, run `pnpm test:sdkwork-workspace-structure-standard`, `pnpm check:pnpm-script-standard`, and `pnpm check:agent-workflow-standard` when changing application-root dictionary, package taxonomy, commands, AGENTS, packaging, or workflow metadata.

## Agent Execution Rules


<!-- SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->
Use dynamic progressive loading for the current task; treat indexes and cross-references as discovery, not as a startup bundle.
Keep `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` and the task-selected standards authoritative; expand context only when evidence exposes a new contract boundary.
Language-specific specs are on-demand: only the touched language loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/JAVA_CODE_SPEC.md`, `../../../sdkwork-specs/TYPESCRIPT_CODE_SPEC.md`, or `../../../sdkwork-specs/FRONTEND_CODE_SPEC.md`.
Package command standardization loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md` only when the current task changes package commands or scripts; GitHub packaging work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md` only when it reaches that workflow boundary.
Do not infer a recursive workspace scan or a broad validation suite from the presence of a path alone.
<!-- /SDKWORK-PROGRESSIVE-LOADING: v1 -->

Use dynamic progressive loading and the convention dictionary before broad source loading. Do not hand-edit generated SDK output. Do not replace generated SDK integration with raw HTTP. Keep changes scoped to the owning package, surface, or app root. Record exact verification commands and important outputs before reporting completion.

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. Source configuration work loads `../../../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## HTTP API Response Envelope

All L2+ SDKWork-owned custom HTTP contracts, including `app-api`, `backend-api`, and SDKWork-owned business `open-api`, `MUST` follow `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5, section 14, and section 15:

- **Default classification:** omitted `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol` means SDKWork-owned custom API (`sdkwork-v3`); only operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` plus `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` identifies a third-party compatibility `open-api` operation.
- **Input:** typed request bodies, section 14.1 list/search/command input, `SdkWorkListQuery`, and `q` for free-text search.
- **Success output:** `SdkWorkApiResponse` with `{ "code": 0, "data": <payload>, "traceId": "<server-uuid>" }`.
- **Error output:** HTTP 4xx/5xx `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) with numeric `code` and `traceId`; SDKWork-owned errors may include `i18nKey` and `locale` presentation metadata.
- Success `code` is numeric `int32`; HTTP 2xx JSON bodies `MUST` use `0` only. REST semantics remain on HTTP status (`201`, `202`, etc.).
- Platform error codes are numeric non-zero values per section 15.3 (`40001`, `40101`, `40401`, …).
- Single resource: `data.item`
- Lists: `data.items` + `data.pageInfo` (`PageInfo.mode` is `offset` or `cursor`)
- Commands: `data.accepted` plus optional `resourceId` / `status`
- Async accept (`202`): `data.operationId`, `data.status`, optional `pollUrl`
- Operation patterns: retrieve/list/search/create/update/delete/command/async/bulk semantics follow `API_SPEC.md` section 15.4; create uses `201`, delete uses `204` with no JSON body, and `PUT`/`PATCH` use SDK action `update`.

Vendor compatibility `open-api` routes that mirror upstream tool or provider wire (for example OpenAI `/v1/*`, Anthropic/Claude `/anthropic/v1/*`, Google/Gemini `/google/v1beta/*`, Claude Code, or Codex) `MAY` opt out only when every exempt operation declares operation-level `x-sdkwork-wire-protocol: external` and `x-sdkwork-external-protocol-id` per `API_SPEC.md` section 4.5.2. SDKWork-owned business `open-api` operations `MUST NOT` opt out. Mixed OpenAPI documents are validated per operation; one external operation never exempts SDKWork-owned operations in the same document.

Errors `MUST` use HTTP 4xx/5xx with `application/problem+json` (`ProblemDetail`) including required numeric `code` and `traceId`. Optional `i18nKey` and `locale` are display metadata only. Business failures `MUST NOT` use HTTP 2xx with non-zero `code`, string wire codes, `success`, or human `message`.

Forbidden legacy envelopes and fields: `PlusApiResult`, `AppbaseApiResult`, `StoreApiResult`, `SdkWorkResponse`, per-domain `*ApiResult`, wire field `requestId`, bare domain DTOs at the HTTP root, and top-level `{ items, pageInfo, traceId }` without `data`.

Handlers `MUST` serialize success and map errors through `sdkwork-web-framework` response mapping. Generated HTTP SDKs (`--standard-profile sdkwork-v3`) unwrap `data` by default and expose typed numeric `ProblemDetail.code` / `traceId` and returned localization metadata on errors; use `.raw` when the full envelope is required.

Before completing API contract, SDK generation, or frontend service work, run:

```bash
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-operation-patterns.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
node <sdkwork-specs>/tools/check-api-response-envelope.mjs --workspace <workspace-root>
```

Authority: `sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` section 4.5 and sections 14–16, `SDK_SPEC.md` section 4.2, `FRONTEND_SPEC.md`, `MIGRATION_SPEC.md` section 4.2.

## Human Review Rules

Request human review before breaking SDKWork standards, changing public naming, altering security/auth behavior, changing generated SDK ownership, changing production release metadata, or deleting tracked runtime/cache files.
