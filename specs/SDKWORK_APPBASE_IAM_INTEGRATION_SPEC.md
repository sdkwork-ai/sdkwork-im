# SDKWork Appbase IAM Integration Standard (Deprecated)

This file is a compatibility shim kept inside `sdkwork-im` so existing local references do not break.

**Canonical standard**: `../sdkwork-specs/IAM_LOGIN_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`

Rationale:

- IAM login/session integration is owned by `sdkwork-iam` packages and the shared SDKWork standards repository.
- Product repositories must not maintain divergent IAM integration standards locally.

This repository-specific document now only hosts **Sdkwork IM reference pointers** and **verification entrypoints** for the canonical standard.

## 1. Canonical Architecture

Frontend flow:

```text
React Router / AuthGate
  -> @sdkwork/auth-pc-react SdkworkIamAuthRoutes
  -> product getSdkwork<App>IamRuntime()
  -> product appAuthService
  -> @sdkwork/iam-sdk-adapter createIamAppSdkAdapter()
  -> generated app SDK client
  -> /app/v3/api/auth | /iam | /oauth | /system/iam
```

Backend/gateway flow:

```text
Browser, desktop renderer, or mobile app
  -> /app/v3/api/auth | /iam | /oauth | /system/iam
  -> web gateway route registry
  -> sdkwork-iam-app-api upstream in split/server mode
  -> product local/private runtime only when embedded mode has no appbase upstream
```

Rules:

- Login, registration, current session, refresh, logout, OAuth, verification codes, password reset, QR login, and current user flows are app-api capabilities under `/app/v3/api`.
- App UI must depend on reusable IAM UI/runtime contracts, not generated SDK constructors.
- Product service code must use the generated app SDK or the approved IAM SDK adapter.
- Backend-api must not expose login/session creation APIs.
- Local/private Rust implementations are parity implementations of appbase IAM, not a divergent product-local auth system.

## 2. Dependency Boundary And Cycle Prevention

The dependency direction is fixed:

```text
product app shell
  -> appbase auth UI package
  -> product IAM runtime factory
  -> product appAuthService
  -> appbase IAM SDK adapter / ports
  -> generated app SDK
```

Rules:

- `@sdkwork/auth-pc-react` and other appbase packages must not import product app packages.
- Product `AuthGate` may import appbase UI and product runtime helpers.
- Product runtime may import appbase auth types, IAM adapters, generated SDK types, and local session helpers.
- Product feature UI must not import generated SDK internals to bypass the runtime/service boundary.
- Generated SDK packages must not import React UI, appbase UI packages, product shell code, or gateway/runtime crates.
- Rust gateway and local runtime crates must not import frontend packages.
- If a reusable appbase package needs product-specific behavior, inject it through runtime interfaces, callbacks, configuration, or appearance tokens. Do not add reverse imports from appbase to the product app.

## 3. Frontend Integration Rules

Every PC React app integrating appbase IAM should provide one auth gate component responsible for route protection and auth route mounting.

Required shape:

```tsx
<SdkworkIamAuthRoutes
  appearance={resolveSdkwork<App>AuthAppearance()}
  basePath="/auth"
  getRuntime={getSdkwork<App>IamRuntime}
  homePath="/"
  locale={resolveAuthLocale()}
  runtimeConfig={resolveSdkwork<App>AuthRuntimeConfig()}
  viewportMode="flow"
/>
```

Rules:

- Auth routes are mounted under `/auth`.
- Unauthenticated protected routes redirect to `/auth/login?redirect=<encoded_target>`.
- Authenticated users visiting `/auth/*` are redirected to the requested redirect target or app home.
- The app must reuse `SdkworkIamAuthRoutes`; it must not maintain a bespoke login/register form for the same flows.
- UI components must not call `appAuthService.login`, `appAuthService.register`, generated SDK auth methods, raw `fetch`, or `axios` directly.
- Theme, shell controls, desktop title bar behavior, and web/desktop AppHeader behavior belong to product shell code, not reusable appbase IAM business logic.
- Web and desktop host differences must be detected at shell/runtime boundaries. They must not change the IAM API path or SDK contract.

Reference implementation:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/src/AuthGate.tsx`

## 4. Product Runtime Contract

Each application provides a small product-specific IAM runtime layer that adapts the appbase auth runtime contract to the product app SDK wrapper.

Required exported helpers:

```ts
getSdkwork<App>IamRuntime()
resetSdkwork<App>IamRuntime()
resolveSdkwork<App>AuthRuntimeConfig()
resolveSdkwork<App>AuthAppearance()
appAuthService
```

The runtime must expose these appbase service groups:

```text
auth.sessions.create
auth.sessions.current.retrieve
auth.sessions.current.update
auth.sessions.current.delete
auth.sessions.refresh
auth.registrations.create
auth.verificationCodes.create
auth.verificationCodes.verify
auth.passwordResetRequests.create, if enabled
auth.passwordResets.create, if enabled
iam.users.current.retrieve
oauth.authorizationUrls.create
oauth.deviceAuthorizations.create
oauth.deviceAuthorizations.retrieve
oauth.deviceAuthorizations.scans.create
oauth.deviceAuthorizations.passwordCompletions.create
oauth.sessions.create
system.iam.runtime.retrieve, when exposed by the UI
system.iam.verificationPolicy.retrieve
```

Rules:

- Unsupported auth methods must fail explicitly with a clear error. They must not silently fake success.
- Runtime config controls which methods the UI presents, for example password login, email registration, phone registration, QR login, OAuth, recovery, and verification policy.
- Token store operations must persist, read, and clear product session tokens through shared session helpers.
- After login, registration, QR completion, refresh, or logout, product SDK clients that cache auth state must be reset.
- Runtime sessions returned to appbase UI must include `authToken`, `accessToken`, optional `refreshToken`, `sessionId`, `user`, and `context` when available.

Reference implementation:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/packages/sdkwork-im-pc-core/src/sdk/appAuthRuntime.ts`

## 5. App Auth Service Contract

Each application provides `appAuthService` as a thin product facade over the approved appbase IAM runtime.

Required service methods:

```ts
getCurrentSession()
logout()
```

Rules:

- Login, registration, verification-code, OAuth, QR auth, password reset, refresh, and current-session mutation are owned by `@sdkwork/auth-pc-react`, `@sdkwork/auth-runtime-pc-react`, and `@sdkwork/iam-runtime`. Product `appAuthService` must not reimplement them.
- `appAuthService` must consume the high-level appbase auth integration (`createSdkworkAuthAppbaseIntegration` or equivalent) and the runtime-backed IAM service, not `createIamAppSdkAdapter`, raw HTTP, or manual auth headers.
- Current-session bootstrap must call `auth.sessions.current.retrieve()` when available. Failed validation clears local session state and remains anonymous; cached tokens or profiles are not sufficient.
- Logout must call `auth.sessions.current.delete()` when available and must always clear local tokens, the global token manager, and downstream SDK caches in `finally`.

Reference implementation:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/packages/sdkwork-im-pc-core/src/sdk/appAuthService.ts`

## 5.1 Credential-Entry Bootstrap Access Token

Anonymous credential-entry operations (login, registration, QR auth session creation, password reset request/completion) require bootstrap tenant isolation through `Access-Token: <JWT access_token>` even when `Authorization` is forbidden.

Rules:

- `createSdkworkAppbasePcAuthRuntime` wraps the IAM app SDK with `@sdkwork/iam-credential-entry` `wrapCredentialEntryClient` by default.
- Before each credential-entry SDK call, the runtime clears session tokens and seeds the global TokenManager from private `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN` only.
- Tracked env templates document `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN=` with blank value. Resolved JWT values belong only in local bootstrap overlays or dev orchestrator env injection.
- Browser/renderer runtimes must not read bootstrap tokens from `VITE_*` or public runtime config. Development serve uses `@sdkwork/iam-credential-entry/vite` and its canonical global handoff; Vite `process.env.SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN` define replacement is forbidden.
- After interactive login succeeds, runtime session `accessToken` supersedes bootstrap credentials for all protected SDK calls.
- The product TokenManager may hold a transient bootstrap-only `accessToken` in memory for credential-entry calls. It must not persist partial single-token sessions; full dual-token sessions still require both `authToken` and `accessToken`.

Development orchestration:

- `scripts/lib/im-pc-dev.mjs` merges bootstrap access token env through `scripts/dev/sdkwork-im-bootstrap-access-token.mjs`.
- Shared helper authority: `sdkwork-iam/scripts/dev/create-dev-bootstrap-access-token-env.mjs`.

Reference implementations:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/packages/sdkwork-im-pc-core/src/sdk/appAuthRuntime.ts`
- `sdkwork-iam/apps/sdkwork-iam-pc/packages/sdkwork-auth-runtime-pc-react/src/appbasePcAuthRuntime.ts`
- `sdkwork-iam/apps/sdkwork-iam-common/packages/sdkwork-iam-credential-entry/`

## 5.2 IAM Product Application Provisioning

Standalone and embedded IM gateways that ship IAM locally must provision the product tenant application before credential-entry routes execute. This mirrors Claw Router database installer behavior through the shared embedded bootstrap framework.

Rules:

- Runtime app id for Sdkwork IM PC is `sdkwork-im-pc`. It must match the JWT `app_id` claim in dev bootstrap `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN` and the product IAM runtime `app.appId`.
- Runtime app id for Sdkwork IM H5 is `sdkwork-im-h5`.
- Application template key is `chat` from `sdkwork.app.config.json`; tenant provisioning uses tenant `100001`, organization `0`, and instance keys derived by `tenant_application_instance_key` (for example `sdkwork_im_pc_dev`, `sdkwork_im_h5_dev`).
- Standalone gateway bootstraps IAM schema, then calls `ensure_im_tenant_application_runtime_from_env` before assembling the embedded IAM router.
- IM `MUST` delegate manifest mapping, Postgres `search_path`, default subject seeding, and tenant-application reconcile/upsert to `sdkwork-iam-embedded-application-bootstrap`. The IM adapter crate only supplies PC/H5 runtime bindings.
- Legacy databases may contain duplicate `iam_tenant_application` rows for the same `(tenant_id, organization_id, template_id)`. The shared framework reconciles those rows, ensures `uk_iam_tenant_application_org_template`, upserts by stable row id, and enables the tenant application.
- `primary_domain` is unique per tenant when configured. Product bootstrap resolves a non-conflicting domain (for example `sdkwork-im-pc.localhost` when `localhost` is already owned by the platform application) before upsert/enable.
- Split/cloud deployments that proxy IAM to external `sdkwork-iam-app-api` do not run this local provisioning step; the upstream IAM control plane owns tenant application records.

Reference implementations:

- `sdkwork-iam/crates/sdkwork-iam-embedded-application-bootstrap`
- `crates/sdkwork-im-iam-application-bootstrap/src/lib.rs`
- `services/sdkwork-im-standalone-gateway/src/main.rs`
- `sdkwork-clawrouter/services/sdkwork-clawrouter-router-service/src/infrastructure/sql/iam_application_bootstrap.rs`

## 6. App SDK Client And Token Rules

Each application exposes a single app SDK client wrapper for app-api calls.

Required wrapper helpers:

```ts
createAppSdkClientConfig(session?)
initAppSdkClient(config?)
getAppSdkClient()
getAppSdkClientWithSession(session?)
resetAppSdkClient()
useAppSdkClient()
resolveAppSdkBaseUrl()
```

Rules:

- Generated app SDK source is the only remote business transport source. Sdkwork IM uses `@sdkwork-internal/im-app-api-generated` for the app-api surface that includes appbase IAM paths.
- Base URL normalization must remove SDK-owned suffixes such as `/app/v3/api` and `/im/v3/api` before constructing the generated SDK client, when the generated client expects an origin/base root.
- Production builds may use same-origin fallback when the web build is served by the unified gateway origin.
- Development may use a documented local gateway fallback, for example `http://127.0.0.1:18079`.
- `authToken` and `accessToken` must be managed through the global TokenManager and generated SDK config, not service-layer manual headers.
- Before interactive login, credential-entry flows may seed the TokenManager from private `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN` only. After login, session tokens replace bootstrap credentials.
- Transient bootstrap-only access tokens are allowed in memory for credential-entry header injection. They must not be written to persisted session storage until a complete dual-token session is available.
- Product service modules must not set `Authorization` or `Access-Token` directly.
- Tenant, organization, platform, and app context headers are built from verified/persisted IAM session context. They must not be taken from mutable route/query/body state.

Session shape:

```ts
{
  accessToken?: string;
  authToken?: string;
  refreshToken?: string;
  context?: IamAppContext;
  expiresAt?: number;
  sessionId?: string;
  user?: IamUserSummary;
}
```

For normal protected app-api operation, both tokens should be present:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <authToken>
Access-Token: <accessToken>
```

Reference implementations:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/packages/sdkwork-im-pc-core/src/sdk/appSdkClient.ts`
- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/packages/sdkwork-im-pc-core/src/sdk/session.ts`

## 7. AppContext Header Rules

The SDK wrapper may attach AppContext headers only from the verified IAM session context.

Standard headers:

```text
X-Sdkwork-App-Id
X-Sdkwork-Tenant-Id
X-Sdkwork-Organization-Id
X-Sdkwork-User-Id
X-Sdkwork-Session-Id
X-Sdkwork-Environment
X-Sdkwork-Deployment-Mode
X-Sdkwork-Auth-Level
X-Sdkwork-Actor-Id
X-Sdkwork-Actor-Kind
X-Sdkwork-Device-Id
X-Sdkwork-Data-Scope
X-Sdkwork-Permission-Scope
X-Sdkwork-Context-Signature, when supported
```

Rules:

- Server-side token/session validation remains authoritative.
- Header context is an SDK/runtime transport optimization and audit hint. It does not replace server verification.
- If request context conflicts with verified token context, server handlers must reject the request unless a documented cross-tenant/platform permission applies.

## 8. Environment Configuration

Applications should support deployment mode and app API base URL configuration through documented environment keys.

Deployment modes:

| Product mode | IAM mode | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop-local` | `private` | Local standalone gateway URLs; credential-entry uses private `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN`; authenticated traffic uses dual-token JWT via collapsed gateway |
| `server-private` | `private` | Private deployment with gateway and service upstreams |
| `cloud-saas` | `cloud` | SaaS deployment using cloud appbase app-api |

Recommended generic keys:

```text
SDKWORK_<APP>_IAM_DEPLOYMENT_MODE
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_IAM_DEPLOYMENT_MODE
VITE_SDKWORK_DEPLOYMENT_MODE
SDKWORK_IAM_MODE
VITE_SDKWORK_IAM_APP_API_BASE_URL
VITE_<APP>_APP_API_BASE_URL
VITE_<APP>_IM_API_BASE_URL
VITE_<APP>_IM_WEBSOCKET_BASE_URL
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_DEFAULT_EMAIL
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_DEFAULT_PHONE
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_DEFAULT_PASSWORD
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_VERIFICATION_CODE
VITE_SDKWORK_<APP>_AUTH_DEV_PREFILL_ENABLED
```

Rules:

- New apps should read generic SDKWork keys first when the shared SDK standard defines them, then app-specific fallback keys where migration requires it.
- Auth runtime development prefill is allowed only for development/test and must be explicitly controlled by environment.
- `authToken` must not be preconfigured in environment. It is runtime session state only.
- App-level `accessToken`, when applicable, may come from app config/env, but a logged-in session access token must override or refresh it according to SDK token manager rules.
- URL validation must reject invalid HTTP/WS base URL values during dev server bootstrap.

Reference implementation:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/scripts/sdkwork-chat-iam-env.mjs`

## 9. Gateway And Backend Routing

The gateway must route appbase IAM app-api paths to `sdkwork-iam-app-api` in split/server mode, and to the product local/private runtime only when embedded mode has no appbase upstream.

Required gateway route descriptors:

```text
serviceId: sdkwork-iam-app-api
paths:
  /app/v3/api/auth/{*path}
  /app/v3/api/iam/{*path}
  /app/v3/api/oauth/{*path}
  /app/v3/api/system/iam/{*path}
sdk target:
  sdkwork-im-app-sdk or the app's generated app SDK target
```

Rules:

- `/app/v3/api/auth/sessions` must route to appbase IAM app-api in split/server mode.
- Embedded mode may delegate missing `sdkwork-iam-app-api` upstreams to the product runtime.
- Product-specific app-api routes, such as portal routes, may be delegated to product runtime by explicit path rules.
- CORS must allow browser and desktop renderer origins and all auth/AppContext headers required by the generated SDK.
- Gateway CORS preflight must be handled locally.
- Backend/admin APIs must stay under `/backend/v3/api` and must not implement app login/register/session creation routes.

Reference implementations:

- `services/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway/src/lib.rs`
- `services/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway/tests/http_proxy_test.rs`
- `crates/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway-config/src/lib.rs`

## 10. Local/Private Runtime Parity

Local/private runtime IAM must expose the same path, method, schema, envelope, error, token, and context semantics as appbase app-api.

Minimum local/private app-api routes:

```text
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/sessions
GET    /app/v3/api/auth/sessions/current
PATCH  /app/v3/api/auth/sessions/current
DELETE /app/v3/api/auth/sessions/current
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/sessions/refresh
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/registrations
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/verification_codes
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/verification_codes/verify
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/password_reset_requests
POST   /app/v3/api/auth/password_resets
GET    /app/v3/api/iam/users/current
GET    /app/v3/api/system/iam/runtime
GET    /app/v3/api/system/iam/verification_policy
POST   /app/v3/api/oauth/authorization_urls
POST   /app/v3/api/oauth/device_authorizations
GET    /app/v3/api/oauth/device_authorizations/{deviceAuthorizationId}
POST   /app/v3/api/oauth/device_authorizations/{deviceAuthorizationId}/scans
POST   /app/v3/api/oauth/device_authorizations/{deviceAuthorizationId}/password_completions
POST   /app/v3/api/oauth/sessions
```

Forbidden legacy paths:

```text
/app/v3/api/auth/login
/app/v3/api/auth/register
/app/v3/api/auth/refresh
/app/v3/api/auth/verify/send
/app/v3/api/auth/verify/check
/app/v3/api/open_platform/qr_auth/sessions
/app/v3/api/open_platform/qr_auth/sessions/{sessionKey}
/app/v3/api/open_platform/qr_auth/sessions/{sessionKey}/scans
/app/v3/api/open_platform/qr_auth/sessions/{sessionKey}/passwords
/auth/login
/auth/register
```

Rules:

- Local/private runtime must be treated as appbase IAM parity, not an application-specific shortcut.
- OpenAPI exports must include the standard appbase IAM paths and must exclude legacy auth paths.
- OperationIds must generate resource-style SDK methods such as `client.auth.sessions.create(body)`.
- Any missing local/private capability must be closed in the runtime contract and OpenAPI export, not hidden by a frontend fallback.

Reference implementations:

- `crates/sdkwork-api-product-runtime/src/local_iam.rs`
- `services/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway/tests/openapi_index_test.rs`
- `services/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway/tests/http_proxy_test.rs`

## 11. Appbase Package And Workspace Aliasing

PC React apps must resolve appbase IAM packages to the canonical workspace/source packages.

Required packages for PC React IAM:

```text
@sdkwork/auth-pc-react
@sdkwork/auth-pc-react/auth
@sdkwork/appbase-pc-react
@sdkwork/iam-contracts
@sdkwork/iam-sdk-adapter
@sdkwork/iam-sdk-ports
```

Rules:

- Vite, TypeScript paths, package manager workspace config, and test tooling must resolve to the same appbase package source.
- Do not create product-local copies of appbase IAM UI packages.
- Do not hand-edit generated SDK output to make appbase package imports compile.
- If appbase UI needs a missing capability, extend the appbase contract and adapter, then regenerate or rebuild the approved wrapper.

Reference implementation:

- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/vite.config.ts`
- `apps/sdkwork-im-pc/scripts/auth-appbase-ui-contract.test.mjs`

## 11.1 Capability Package Composition And Dedupe

Appbase IAM UI integration may compose multiple capability packages (for example appbase foundation packages, shell packages, and product packages). Capability registries are allowed to treat duplicate capability package names as fatal, because duplicate registration can mask mismatched versions and inconsistent capability manifests.

Rules:

- `createSdkworkAuthAppbaseIntegration` inputs that accept additional package lists (for example `extraPackageNames`) **MUST be idempotent**: passing a package name that is already included by default catalogs **MUST NOT** crash the app.
- Product apps **MUST NOT** add shell-level capability packages (for example `@sdkwork/shell-pc-react`) to `extraPackageNames`. Shell capabilities are owned by the shell/runtime and may already be included by upstream appbase or foundation presets.
- Product apps **MAY** add product packages (for example `@sdkwork/im-pc-react`) to `extraPackageNames` when they provide product capability manifests. Product packages should not re-export or alias shell capability packages.
- If the upstream integration factory does not de-dupe package names, product integration code **MUST** guard startup by catching the duplicate-capability error and retrying without the optional extra packages. This is a compatibility bridge, not the long-term preferred behavior.

Rationale:

- Duplicate capability packages are often introduced by a split-brain catalog (shell already included by a preset, and re-included by an extra list).
- Treating duplicates as fatal surfaces inconsistent dependency graphs early, but factories must still tolerate idempotent inputs to avoid breaking downstream apps during catalog refactors.

## 12. Verification Requirements

Each integrated app must include structural and behavioral verification.

Frontend structural checks:

- `AuthGate` imports `SdkworkIamAuthRoutes` from `@sdkwork/auth-pc-react`.
- `AuthGate` mounts appbase routes with `basePath="/auth"` and `homePath="/"`.
- `AuthGate` does not define a bespoke `<form>` for login/register.
- Product UI does not call `appAuthService.login` or `appAuthService.register` outside the appbase runtime.
- Appbase package aliases resolve to canonical workspace packages.
- Host-specific shell behavior, such as desktop AppHeader visibility, stays outside appbase IAM business logic.

Service/SDK checks:

- `appAuthService` exposes only approved bootstrap/logout bridges (`getCurrentSession`, `logout`).
- Auth UI/runtime owns login, registration, QR auth, OAuth, refresh, and verification-code flows through `@sdkwork/auth-runtime-pc-react`.
- Credential-entry bootstrap uses `@sdkwork/iam-credential-entry` through `createSdkworkAppbasePcAuthRuntime`.
- Dev orchestration injects private `SDKWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN` before renderer startup when absent.
- Standalone gateway provisions tenant application runtime `sdkwork-im-pc` for tenant `100001` before serving credential-entry routes.
- Service code does not use raw `fetch`, manual `Authorization`, or manual `Access-Token`.
- Session persistence stores `authToken`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `context`, `sessionId`, and `user` when returned.
- SDK clients reset after session mutation.

Gateway/runtime checks:

- `/app/v3/api/auth/sessions` routes to `sdkwork-iam-app-api` in split/server mode.
- Embedded mode delegates missing appbase upstream IAM requests to product runtime.
- CORS preflight succeeds and allows auth/AppContext headers.
- OpenAPI app schema includes standard IAM and OAuth device authorization paths.
- OpenAPI app schema excludes legacy auth paths.

Reference commands for Sdkwork IM:

```text
node apps/sdkwork-im-pc/scripts/auth-appbase-ui-contract.test.mjs
node scripts/dev/sdkwork-im-iam-application-bootstrap-standard.test.mjs
node scripts/dev/sdkwork-im-bootstrap-access-token.test.mjs
node apps/sdkwork-im-pc/scripts/sdk-runtime-token-manager-contract.test.mjs
cargo test -p sdkwork-im-iam-application-bootstrap
cargo test -p sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway --test http_proxy_test
cargo test -p sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway --test openapi_index_test
```

Run narrower tests first, then broader workspace checks when the blast radius warrants it.

## 12.1 Member Capability And Permission Composition

Registered IM members use the IAM `app_user` role — not admin bootstrap scope. Capability layers:

| Layer | Member expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Self profile | `GET /iam/users/current` requires `iam:self`; profile mutations require `iam.profile.update` |
| Directory browse | `iam.organizations.read`, `iam.memberships.read`, `iam.departments.read`, `iam.assignments.read` on session RBAC |
| Bootstrap token | `sdkwork.app.config.json` `backend.accessTokenPermissionScope` is credential-entry only; keep minimal (`iam:self`) |
| Embedded knowledge | Tenant guard: JWT `tenant_id` must match `SDKWORK_KNOWLEDGEBASE_TENANT_ID` (default `100001`); app-api RBAC uses `knowledge.spaces.*` / `knowledge.documents.*` |
| Embedded mail | App-api RBAC uses standard `mail.*` codes enforced from route manifest via web-framework |

Client app roots declare `contracts.permissionComposition` per `APP_PERMISSION_COMPOSITION_SPEC.md`. Machine contract: `specs/im-member-capability.spec.json`.

After IAM role or bootstrap changes: restart standalone gateway and re-login so JWT `permission_scope` refreshes.
