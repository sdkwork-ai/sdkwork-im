# Wave D 2026-04-08 Bundle Manifest

## Release Snapshot

- bundle id: `wave-d-2026-04-08`
- wave: `wave-d`
- archive baseline scope: `Step 13`, `Wave D / 93`
- bundle archive decision: `go`
- server package gate decision: `pending_go_no_go`
- SDK publication state: `template_only_pending_generation`

This manifest freezes the current release-bundle snapshot for repository audit, rollback planning,
and traceability. It does not claim that all server installers are built or that any SDK package is
already published.

## Frozen State Summary

### Bundle Scope

- the bundle is a release archive baseline, not a complete end-to-end publication pipeline
- `standalone.development` still uses topology v2 `standalone.development` service contract shape
- the archive is already sufficient for audit, rollback planning, and traceability

### SDK State

- the SDK family release snapshot is frozen in `sdk-release-catalog.json`
- current catalog state: `template_only_pending_generation`
- current generated HTTP SDK artifact state: `generationStatus = generated`
- current RTC provider-runtime SDK artifact state: `generationStatus = template_only_pending_generation`
- current tracked artifact publication state: `releaseStatus = not_published`
- version-freeze fields remain explicit:
  - `plannedVersion = null`
  - `versionStatus = version_unassigned_pending_freeze`
  - `versionDecisionSourcePath = null`
- the release catalog must be derived from the checked-in `.sdkwork-assembly.json` files through
  `sync-sdk-release-catalog.mjs`, not edited by hand

### Server Packaging State

- server package catalog state: `template_only_pending_build`
- server release gate state: `template_only_pending_evaluation`
- server release decision status: `pending_go_no_go`
- the canonical payload layout and platform package matrix are frozen, but archive and native
  installer artifacts are still template-only placeholders

## Archive Goals

- auditable
- rollback-ready
- traceable

When package publication or real server installer builds happen later, this bundle layout should be
extended in place rather than replaced with a new ad hoc structure.
