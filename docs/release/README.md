# Release Documentation

Status: active
Owner: SDKWork IM maintainers
Specs: `../sdkwork-specs/RELEASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SUPPLY_CHAIN_SECURITY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/QUALITY_GATE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DOCUMENTATION_SPEC.md`

## Purpose

`docs/release/` records release changelogs, release notes, go/no-go decisions, commercial readiness evidence, and rollout or rollback conclusions for SDKWork IM. It is an evidence layer, not a place to lower SDKWork standards or preserve compatibility debt.

## Required Files

Each release or pre-release verification loop maintains:

- `docs/release/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/release/YYYY-MM-DD-vX.Y.Z-loop-XX.md`

Add these when a release decision is made:

- `docs/release/YYYY-MM-DD-vX.Y.Z-release-notes.md`
- `docs/release/YYYY-MM-DD-vX.Y.Z-go-no-go.md`

## Version Rules

- Before commercial GA, versions stay in the `0.y.z` range.
- `minor`: new capability, completed wave/step closure, or externally visible enhancement.
- `patch`: bug fix, standard alignment, documentation, test, script, or non-breaking optimization.
- `major`: breaking contract change or formal commercial GA.
- `1.0.0` is allowed only after the commercial release gate passes with real evidence.

## Changelog Requirements

Every changelog entry must include:

- date and version;
- affected step, component, API, SDK, database, or deployment surface;
- behavior and contract impact;
- migration, downgrade, and rollback notes when applicable;
- verification commands and important outputs;
- documentation updates;
- remaining risks or blockers.

## Commercial Readiness Gate

Before release or go/no-go review, run:

```bash
node scripts/release/commercial-readiness.mjs
```

The gate must fail closed:

- `exit code 1`: code, config, dependency, package, or verification failure.
- `exit code 2`: implementation checks pass but required release evidence is incomplete.
- `exit code 0`: all required implementation checks and release evidence pass.

Implementation and tool failures remain fail-fast because later results may depend on their
outputs. Release-evidence failures are aggregated: the gate continues independent implementation
checks, evaluates cloud image, Pre-Release Tier, Capacity Tier, and app package evidence, then
returns exit code `2` with every blocked stage in `readinessBlockers`. CI and go/no-go automation
must consume the complete blocker set and must not treat a partially populated evidence report as
commercial sign-off.

## Release Package Matrix

The SDKWork IM release package matrix is authoritative only when these four
surfaces match exactly:

- `sdkwork.workflow.json` target ids;
- `scripts/release/plan-sdkwork-im-install-packages.mjs --json --check` output;
- `sdkwork.app.config.json` `artifacts.installConfig.packages[].id`;
- current release note `packageIds`.

Current `0.1.0` package targets:

- `web-universal-cloud-browser-zip`: cloud browser web ZIP bundle.
- `linux-x64-standalone-server-tar-gz`
- `linux-arm64-standalone-server-tar-gz`
- `macos-x64-standalone-server-tar-gz`
- `macos-arm64-standalone-server-tar-gz`
- `windows-x64-standalone-server-zip`
- `windows-arm64-standalone-server-zip`
- `linux-x64-standalone-desktop-zip`
- `linux-arm64-standalone-desktop-zip`
- `macos-x64-standalone-desktop-zip`
- `macos-arm64-standalone-desktop-zip`
- `windows-x64-standalone-desktop-zip`
- `windows-arm64-standalone-desktop-zip`

Browser web release packages must stage `web/sdkwork-im-pc/dist/` plus
`web-manifest.json`. Server and desktop package targets remain standalone
runtime targets. Retired targets such as `macos-universal-standalone-desktop-dmg`
and `linux-x64-standalone-desktop-appimage` must not reappear without a new
approved package target and matching workflow, manifest, release note, staging,
packaging, validation, and commercial-readiness evidence.

## Evidence Rules

Release evidence must be real and reproducible:

- If `security.checksumRequired=true`, every enabled direct distribution package must record a real SHA-256 checksum.
- If `security.signatureRequired=true`, every enabled direct distribution package must record signing, notarization, Sigstore, GPG, Authenticode, or equivalent signing evidence.
- If `security.sbomRequired=true`, every enabled direct distribution package must record CycloneDX/SPDX SBOM evidence plus provenance or attestation evidence.
- Enabled media assets under `media.icons`, `media.screenshots`, and `media.previews` must not retain `metadata.generatedPlaceholder=true`.
- Step 11 capacity evidence must include `capacity-tier-evidence-index.json` collected from real load, soak, failover, and resource-limit runs.
- Step 11 pre-release evidence must include `pre-release-tier-evidence-index.json` collected from real verification runs.
- UI release evidence that covers browser or desktop flows must include Playwright run output, screenshots, traces, or equivalent recorded artifacts from the exercised release candidate.
- Evidence values must be non-empty strings, arrays, or objects with explicit
  `ref`, `path`, `url`, `uri`, or equivalent reference fields.
- Empty evidence objects or arrays are blockers.
- Local relative evidence references are validated from the repository root,
  must use portable forward-slash paths, must stay inside the repository, and
  must exist. Remote URL or URI evidence references are accepted as remote
  references but must still point to real release evidence.

Missing checksums, signatures, SBOMs, provenance, attestations, media assets, or Step 11 evidence are release blockers. Do not replace them with empty values, placeholder strings, inferred values, or documentation claims.

## Release Evidence Synchronization

After real package archives are built under `dist/release-packages/`, synchronize
package evidence into `sdkwork.app.config.json` through the explicit evidence
sync script:

```bash
pnpm release:validate:evidence -- --json
pnpm release:stage:evidence -- --json
```

The script reads:

- `dist/release-packages/release-packages-manifest.json`;
- package archives and adjacent `*.manifest.json` files under
  `dist/release-packages/`;
- package evidence under `dist/release-evidence/<package-id>/`.

Supported package evidence file names are based on the archive file name:

- signing: `<archive>.sig`, `<archive>.asc`, `<archive>.sigstore.json`,
  `<archive>.minisig`, or `<archive>.p7s`;
- SBOM: `<archive>.cdx.json` or `<archive>.spdx.json`;
- provenance or attestation: `<archive>.intoto.jsonl`,
  `<archive>.attestation.jsonl`, or `<archive>.provenance.json`.

`release:validate:evidence` is read-only and fails when any selected enabled
direct distribution package lacks a real archive, adjacent manifest, signature,
SBOM, or provenance/attestation file. `release:stage:evidence` writes
`sdkwork.app.config.json` only after the evidence plan is complete. The script
computes SHA-256 from the real archive bytes and keeps published package URLs
unchanged. It does not generate signatures, SBOMs, provenance, attestations, or
media assets.

## Go/No-Go Rule

Documentation must not state that SDKWork IM is commercially deliverable until:

- `node scripts/release/commercial-readiness.mjs` exits `0`;
- `sdkwork.app.config.json` and app-level manifests contain real required release evidence;
- no enabled package keeps null checksum/signature/SBOM evidence where the security policy requires it;
- no enabled release media keeps `metadata.generatedPlaceholder=true`;
- API, SDK, pagination, database, security, performance, and deployment gates relevant to the release have passed.
