# PC Commercial Readiness Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the SDKWork IM PC application and its required shared backend safe, bounded, standards-compliant, and verifiably ready for a production release candidate.

**Architecture:** Preserve the existing service, repository, adapter, SDK, and PC package boundaries. Correct data races and pagination at their authoritative stores, keep clients cursor-opaque, make desktop state principal-scoped and lease-based, and make gateways drain before termination. Treat PostgreSQL as the production source of truth and desktop SQLite as a bounded offline cache, not as a server database substitute.

**Tech Stack:** Rust, Tokio, SQLx/PostgreSQL, Tauri/SQLite, TypeScript/React, generated SDKWork TypeScript SDKs, Kubernetes, pnpm, Cargo.

**Execution mode:** Inline execution in the current workspace because repository instructions do not authorize sub-agent delegation and the worktree already contains user changes. Do not commit, reset, clean, or overwrite unrelated changes.

- [x] Introduce a typed `OutboxClaim`/filter boundary and transactional claim operation with a bounded lease.
- [x] Make publish/fail transitions compare the claim token and current state.
- [x] Remove the normal-path behavior that marks another domain's event as failed.
- [x] Run `cargo test -p im-adapters-postgres-journal` and `cargo test -p sdkwork-api-im-assembly`.

### Task 2: Replace Sequence Arithmetic With Opaque Backward Message Cursors

**Files:**

- [x] Add a failing PC test proving cursors are passed through unchanged and never parsed.
- [x] Define `cursor` + `page_size` with opaque, versioned, URL-safe cursor semantics and stable descending keyset order.
- [x] Return each page in UI chronological order while continuing backward from the oldest loaded message.
- [x] Remove `afterSeq`, numeric cursor compatibility, and client sequence arithmetic because the application is pre-launch.

- [x] Preserve the existing failing same-session fence integration test as RED.
- [x] Add tests for different session, principal kind, stale fence, and idempotent reconnect.
- [x] Centralize the fence decision so disconnect and presence paths use one policy.

- [ ] Add RED tests proving non-admin users cannot mount admin routes and permission-denied pages do not render privileged labels/data.
- [ ] Remove server-secret retrieval/display contracts from all client surfaces.
- [ ] Implement reachable admin/console services through generated SDK methods or remove the route/menu from delivered capabilities until the contract exists.

- [ ] Add active connection, upgrade rejection, event-loop lag, queue depth, DB pool, Redis, RSS, and latency scaling signals.
- [ ] Restore lockfile consistency through pnpm; do not hand-edit lockfile entries.
- [ ] Generate real checksums, signatures, SBOM, provenance, and attestations from build artifacts; placeholders must fail release assessment.
- [ ] Replace generated placeholder media with reviewed PC release assets before publication evidence can pass.
- [ ] Run commercial readiness and production deployment gates; record external capacity/signing work as release blockers until real evidence exists.

### Task 9: Canonical Documentation And Final Verification

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/product/prd/PRD.md` and active PRD shards
- Modify: `docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md` and relevant ADRs

- [ ] Update requirements and ADRs before closing each architecture/security/migration decision.
- [ ] Document PostgreSQL as production truth and desktop SQLite as a bounded principal-scoped offline cache.
- [ ] Align one version authority and remove stale production-readiness claims until their gates pass.
- [ ] Document cursor semantics without exposing cursor internals, shutdown ordering, recovery, RPO/RTO, and capacity assumptions.
- [ ] Run narrow tests after every task, then `cargo fmt --check`, relevant Clippy/tests, PC typecheck/build/Playwright, API/envelope/pagination/SDK/composition/security/deployment/database/documentation checks, and commercial readiness.
- [ ] Re-run the original audit checklist and leave no known unresolved item marked complete without executable evidence.
