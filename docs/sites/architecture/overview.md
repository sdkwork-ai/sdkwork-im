# Architecture Overview

Sdkwork IM is a multi-service Rust workspace, not a single binary with optional extras. The current
documentation is easiest to understand through five architectural lenses:

1. The workspace layout and contract crates
2. Topology v2 connectivity planes (`application.public-ingress` + `platform.api-gateway`)
3. The separate `control-plane-api`
4. The unified `sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway` / `sdkwork-im-server` application ingress
5. The runtime-directory persistence contract and shared storage baseline

## Core Architecture Facts

| Fact | Current implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Application ingress binary | `crates/sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway` with `[[bin]] name = "sdkwork-im-server"` |
| Default IM open-platform prefix | `/im/v3/api/*` |
| Default app-development prefix | `/app/v3/api/*` |
| Default backend/operator prefix | `/backend/v3/api/*` |
| Default dev application ingress | `127.0.0.1:18079` (`standalone.development`; IM + embedded IAM) |
| Default dev platform gateway | `127.0.0.1:18079` (collapsed onto application ingress in unified standalone dev) |
| Production IM host | `im.sdkwork.com` |
| Production platform gateway | `api.sdkwork.com` |
| Standalone control-plane bind address | `127.0.0.1:18081` |
| Public auth model | SDKWork dual token at appbase boundary; framework-resolved AppContext inside SDKWork IM |
| Control-plane permissions | `control.read` and `control.write` |

## Application Ingress

`sdkwork-im-server` is the packaged application ingress. In `cloud` layouts it proxies to
internal IM services declared in `specs/topology.spec.json`. In `unified-process` layouts it runs the
assembled runtime in one process for smoke and local verification.

Domains exposed through the ingress include:

- client route recovery, presence, and realtime delivery
- conversation lifecycle, normalized inbox queries, membership, and read state
- messages, media, streams, and RTC
- notifications, automation, audit, and operator diagnostics
- principal-profile, object-storage, RTC, and IoT-related provider health surfaces

Routing is implemented in `crates/sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway`.

## Control Plane

`services/control-plane-api` is a distinct governance service. It is responsible for:

- protocol registry snapshots
- protocol governance snapshots
- provider registry and effective binding views
- provider policy preview, commit, diff, history, and rollback
- realtime node drain, activate, and route migration

This surface is implemented in `services/control-plane-api/src/lib.rs` and started by a separate
binary that binds `127.0.0.1:18081` in `services/control-plane-api/src/main.rs`.

## Unified Gateway And Packaged Server

`crates/sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway` publishes the packaged application ingress boundary. Its discovery surface
includes `GET /openapi.json`, `GET /openapi/index.json`, and `GET /openapi/runtime-summary.json`,
along with rendered docs and per-service OpenAPI proxies.

## Runtime Directory Boundary

`SDKWORK_IM_RUNTIME_DIR` identifies deployment-owned process files, diagnostics, and bounded
temporary runtime material. It is not an IM business database and does not contain an authoritative
copy of current Conversation, Message, Member, or ReadCursor state. Normalized IM business state is
stored in PostgreSQL.

Some services still expose explicitly configured file-backed facilities for development and test
profiles, including the social runtime fallback. Those facilities are single-node test aids, not a
production persistence option. Production profiles use the required durable PostgreSQL adapters and
fail closed when those adapters are unavailable. The runtime directory never provides state
reconstruction or a second business-state authority.

## Storage Management Is Now A Shared Module Baseline

Storage configuration management is no longer treated as app-specific admin glue. The current
repository state already includes:

- `im-storage-contracts` for provider schema, typed input payloads, secret redaction, effective
  resolution, and store contracts
- `im-storage-runtime` for validation, save and delete orchestration, audit capture, and
  snapshot-backed hydration
- compatibility re-exports, admin sandbox wiring, and a standalone admin storage module that consume
  the shared storage model

The architectural implication is that tenant/global storage behavior, provider credential semantics,
and future upload issuance flows should converge on the same storage runtime instead of rebuilding
provider logic in each consumer surface.

Read [Storage Management](/architecture/storage-management) before changing admin storage flows,
provider fallback rules, or media upload wiring.

## Provider Defaults

The platform-default provider registry currently selects these defaults:

| Domain | Selected plugin |
| --- | --- |
| `rtc` | `rtc-volcengine` |
| `object-storage` | `object-storage-volcengine` |
| `principal-profile` | `principal-profile-upstream-context` (default), `principal-profile-external-catalog` (read-only catalog mode) |

These defaults come from the platform provider registry contract and are surfaced through runtime
tests for app, ops, and control-plane endpoints.

## Development Profiles

Use topology profile ids under `etc/topology/` and `pnpm dev` / `pnpm dev:server` for development.
