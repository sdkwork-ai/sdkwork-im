# Local Binary

Local development uses topology v4 orchestration through Node scripts and the
`sdkwork-im-server` ingress binary.

## Development Commands

| Command | Profile | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | `standalone.development` | Default PostgreSQL standalone browser dev stack |
| `pnpm dev:browser` | `standalone.development` | Browser dev stack |
| `pnpm dev:desktop` | `standalone.development` | Desktop dev stack |
| `pnpm dev:server` | `standalone.development` | Server-only development stack |

Configuration authority:

- `specs/topology.spec.json`
- `etc/topology/*.env`

## Application Ingress Binary

Build and test the ingress directly:

```bash
cargo build -p sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway
cargo test -p sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway --tests
```

The packaged binary name is `sdkwork-im-server`.

## Default Dev Bind Address

Application ingress listens on `127.0.0.1:18079` in the default standalone development profile.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18079/healthz
```

## Packaged Server Install

For production-style install, service management, PostgreSQL-backed storage, and release bundles,
use [Server Lifecycle](/deployment/server-lifecycle) with `bin/start-server.*` and
`deployments/templates/server.env.example`.
