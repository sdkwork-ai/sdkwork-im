# Continuous Optimization: Step 11 Closure Claim Supersession

## Goal

- Supersede stale Step 11 “fully closed” wording where it conflicts with the current high-tier evidence state.

## Scope

- Correct the most misleading historical docs only.
- Do not rewrite the Step 11 baseline itself.
- Preserve the current truthful state model.

## 2026-04-09 Correction

- This historical closure claim is superseded by the Step 11 tier evidence indexes added on 2026-04-09.
- Step 11 capability baseline was closed for CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence only.
- Pre-Release Tier now moves to evidence_collected_gate_blocked.
- Capacity Tier still stays template_only_pending_execution.
- message_metrics was collected on 2026-04-09.
- stream_metrics was collected on 2026-04-09.
- All truthful Pre-Release Tier slots are now materialized.
- Pre-Release Tier is still not full gate sign-off because the artifacts are doc-captured from published CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence.

## Implementation

- Add a regression test that requires correction notes in the historical docs.
- Add concise correction blocks to the affected docs.
- Backwrite the decision into `docs/review/`, `docs/step/`, and `docs/架构/`.
