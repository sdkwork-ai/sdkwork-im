# Continuous Optimization: Install/Deploy CMD Help GNU-Surface Contract

## Current Step / Wave

- Step: `12`
- Mode: continuous optimization after Step 12 closure

## Why This Round

- `retired-lifecycle-install` and `retired-lifecycle-deploy` are still part of the documented Windows operator path.
- Their `.cmd` launchers already accepted GNU-style switches through the forwarder.
- The remaining real gap was discoverability: local `--help` still exposed only PowerShell syntax.

## Closure Target

1. Add Windows regressions for `(retired lifecycle script) --help` and `pnpm dev --help`.
2. Reproduce the real help-surface drift first.
3. Patch only the help text surface.
4. Backwrite review, step, architecture, and indexes for this loop.

## Actual Delivery

- Added `test_install_local_cmd_help_surfaces_gnu_style_named_flags`
- Added `test_deploy_local_cmd_help_surfaces_gnu_style_named_flags`
- Reproduced the missing `.cmd` help lines before patching
- Added GNU-style `.cmd` usage lines to the `-Help` branches in `(retired lifecycle script)` and `pnpm dev`
- Backwrote review and architecture docs for this loop

## Verification

```powershell
cargo test -p sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway --offline cmd_help_surfaces_gnu_style_named_flags -- --nocapture
cmd /c .\bin\retired-lifecycle-install.cmd --help
cmd /c .\bin\retired-lifecycle-deploy.cmd --help
cargo test -p sdkwork-api-im-standalone-gateway --offline -- --nocapture
cargo fmt --all --check
```

## Next Round

- Continue from the now smaller backlog:
  - validate failure behavior for invalid `principal-profile-external-catalog` runtime selection
  - deepen real provider/plugin adapters instead of only tightening operator seams
