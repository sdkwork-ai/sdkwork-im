# Continuous Optimization: Step 11 Closure Claim Supersession

## Finding

- Several historical Step 11 review and architecture docs still said `Step 11` was fully closed.
- The current repo source of truth says otherwise: `Pre-Release Tier` is gate-blocked and `Capacity Tier` is still incomplete.

## Root Cause

- Earlier Step 11 closure docs froze the CI Smoke Tier capability baseline before the repo added machine-readable high-tier evidence indexes.
- Once `Pre-Release Tier` and `Capacity Tier` evidence state became explicit, the historical closure wording was not superseded.

## 2026-04-09 Correction

- This historical closure claim is superseded by the Step 11 tier evidence indexes added on 2026-04-09.
- Step 11 capability baseline was closed for CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence only.
- Pre-Release Tier now moves to evidence_collected_gate_blocked.
- Capacity Tier still stays template_only_pending_execution.
- message_metrics was collected on 2026-04-09.
- stream_metrics was collected on 2026-04-09.
- All truthful Pre-Release Tier slots are now materialized.
- Pre-Release Tier is still not full gate sign-off because the artifacts are doc-captured from published CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence.

## Fix

- Add explicit correction blocks to the most misleading historical docs.
- Keep the historical execution record, but override the stale closure reading with the current source of truth.

## Source Of Truth

- `artifacts/perf/step-11/pre-release/pre-release-tier-evidence-index.json`
- `artifacts/perf/step-11/capacity/capacity-tier-evidence-index.json`

## Next Gap

- Keep the current truth explicit: `Pre-Release Tier` is gate-blocked and `Capacity Tier` is still template-only.
