# Continuous Optimization: Step 11 Pre-Release Stream Metrics Collected Evidence

## Goal

- Close the last truthful Step 11 `Pre-Release Tier` evidence slot by moving `stream_metrics` from placeholder-only to collected evidence.

## Scope

- Collect only `stream/metrics.json`.
- Move `Pre-Release Tier` from partial collection to `evidence_collected_gate_blocked`.
- Keep `Capacity Tier` unchanged at `template_only_pending_execution`.

## Implementation

- Add `artifacts/perf/step-11/pre-release/stream/metrics.json`.
- Preserve the field mapping explicitly: `frameP95Ms <- appendP95Ms`.
- Update `pre-release-tier-evidence-index.json` to `collectedSlots = 7`, `pendingSlots = 0`.
- Recompute `artifact-file-list.txt` and `checksum-manifest.txt`.
- Backwrite the change into concise review and architecture docs.

## Expected State

- `Pre-Release Tier`: `evidence_collected_gate_blocked`
- collected artifact: `artifacts/perf/step-11/pre-release/stream/metrics.json`
- key metric: `frameP95Ms = 0.117`
- supporting metric: `framesPerSecond = 10613.071`
- `Capacity Tier`: `template_only_pending_execution`

## Boundary

- This is the final truthful `Pre-Release Tier` artifact promoted from published CP11-2 local stream evidence.
- It is not full gate sign-off because the evidence is still doc-captured from published CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development output.
