# SDKWork Specs Structure Alignment Design

## Context

`sdkwork-im` is a mixed SDKWork application repository with Rust services, generated SDK families,
release tooling, and the PC React/Tauri application root at `apps/sdkwork-chat-pc`. The repository
now follows the canonical sibling standards under `../sdkwork-specs`, especially
`SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `APPLICATION_SPEC.md`, `APP_PC_ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`,
`DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`, and `TEST_SPEC.md`.

The current tree already has local SDKWORK entrypoints at the repository root, but the new
structure exposes gaps:

- Standard top-level capability directories such as `apis/`, `jobs/`, `plugins/`, `examples/`,
  `etc/`, and `tests/` are missing.
- The repository root has `package.json` with `workspace:*` dependencies but no root
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- `apps/sdkwork-chat-pc` is an independent application root with `sdkwork.app.config.json`, but it
  does not yet have its own `AGENTS.md` or source-controlled `.sdkwork/` dictionary.
- PC console and admin package names still use historical `sdkwork-clawchat-console-*` and
  `sdkwork-clawchat-admin-*` names rather than the target `sdkwork-clawchat-pc-console-*` and
  `sdkwork-clawchat-pc-admin-*` families.
- `.sdkwork/dart/pub-cache` had tracked runtime/cache state under the repository metadata directory.

The workspace also contains existing uncommitted source changes. This alignment must not revert,
rewrite, or reformat unrelated work.

## Decision

Use a compatible standards-alignment pass rather than a breaking rename migration.

This pass will make the SDKWork structure executable and discoverable while preserving existing
package paths and developer commands. It will add standards entrypoints, root layout placeholders,
root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` authority, migration documentation, and a static verification command.

## Scope

In scope:

- Add missing standard top-level directory placeholders and README files.
- Add `apps/sdkwork-chat-pc` application-root `AGENTS.md`, compatibility shims, and `.sdkwork/`
  metadata files.
- Add root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as the central source dependency authority for the repository workspace.
- Keep the app-local `apps/sdkwork-chat-pc/pnpm-workspace.yaml` as compatibility during migration.
- Add a static SDKWORK workspace structure test.
- Wire the new test into `package.json` and the commercial governance node test catalog.
- Document the historical PC console/admin package naming exception.
- Ignore future `.sdkwork/dart/pub-cache` content and remove the currently tracked cache entries
  from the Git index while preserving local files on disk.

Out of scope:

- Renaming console/admin packages.
- Moving existing root `config/` files.
- Editing generated SDK output.
- Regenerating SDKs.
- Running package install commands that rewrite lockfiles.
- Touching current notary, RTC, or Rust service work already modified in the tree.

## Architecture

The repository root remains the primary SDKWork repository/application root. It owns canonical
project-root capability directories and native build-tool workspace declarations.

`apps/sdkwork-chat-pc` remains an independent PC application root. It owns PC-specific bootstrap,
packages, scripts, specs, app manifest, and local `.sdkwork/` metadata. Its package names are
validated in compatibility mode: normalized `sdkwork-clawchat-pc-*` packages are accepted, and
legacy console/admin package names must be explicitly listed as a migration exception.

The new verification script will be deterministic Node.js code under `scripts/`, using filesystem
and YAML text checks only. It will fail fast with actionable messages and avoid broad source scans
that would be expensive or noisy.

## Testing

Focused verification:

- `node scripts/sdkwork-workspace-structure-standard.test.mjs`
- `pnpm run test:sdkwork-workspace-structure-standard`
- `pnpm run test:workflow-commercial-gates`

Broader verification when practical:

- `pnpm run check:commercial-readiness`

The commercial readiness check may still be blocked by unrelated existing changes or capacity
evidence gates; those results must be reported as evidence, not hidden.

## Migration Notes

The historical PC console/admin names are treated as an approved local compatibility exception for
this pass only. New packages should use the PC architecture naming target:

- `sdkwork-clawchat-pc-console-*`
- `sdkwork-clawchat-pc-admin-*`

The `.sdkwork/dart/pub-cache` entries have been removed from Git tracking with `git rm --cached`.
Local cache files remain on disk and are ignored by the repository and `.sdkwork/` ignore rules.
The workspace structure test now fails if these cache entries are tracked again.
