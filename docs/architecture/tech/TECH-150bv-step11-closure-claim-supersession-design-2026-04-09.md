# Step 11 Closure Claim Supersession Design

## Decision

- Preserve the historical Step 11 execution record.
- Override stale “fully closed” readings with an explicit correction note tied to the current evidence indexes.

## State Model

- Step 11 capability baseline: closed at CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development level
- Pre-Release Tier: `evidence_collected_gate_blocked`
- Capacity Tier: `template_only_pending_execution`
- `message_metrics` was collected on `2026-04-09`
- `stream_metrics` was collected on `2026-04-09`
- All truthful Pre-Release Tier slots are now materialized.

## 2026-04-09 Correction

- This historical closure claim is superseded by the Step 11 tier evidence indexes added on 2026-04-09.
- Step 11 capability baseline was closed for CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence only.
- Pre-Release Tier now moves to evidence_collected_gate_blocked.
- Capacity Tier still stays template_only_pending_execution.
- Pre-Release Tier is still not full gate sign-off because the artifacts are doc-captured from published CI Smoke Tier / standalone.development evidence.

## Boundary

- This change corrects interpretation only.
- It does not claim new performance or HA/DR evidence.
