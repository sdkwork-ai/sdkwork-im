# Getting Started

This section is for engineers, integrators, and operators who need to run Sdkwork IM with topology v4
defaults and minimal surprises.

## What You Get

- Topology v4 development orchestration via `pnpm dev` and `pnpm dev:server`.
- Application ingress at `sdkwork-im-server` plus platform plane via sibling `sdkwork-api-cloud-gateway`.
- OpenAPI-style API documentation aligned to the implemented HTTP surface.
- Clear boundaries between IM standard APIs, app-business APIs, backend control/admin APIs, and SDK workspaces.

## Supported Runtime Modes

| Mode | Entry points | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development stack | `pnpm dev`, `pnpm dev:browser`, `pnpm dev:desktop`, `pnpm dev:server` | Local development, PC integration, smoke |
| Packaged server | `bin/install-server.*`, `bin/start-server.*`, `bin/verify-server.*` | Production-style single-port installs |
| Standalone control plane | `cargo run -p governance-service --offline` | Governance API development |

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain with `cargo`
- Node.js 22 + pnpm 10
- Sibling checkout: `sdkwork-api-cloud-gateway`

## Runtime Profiles

Authority: `specs/topology.spec.json` and `etc/topology/*.env`.

| Profile id | Command | Application ingress |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standalone.development` | `pnpm dev` / `pnpm dev:browser` / `pnpm dev:desktop` | `http://127.0.0.1:18079` |
| `cloud.development` | `pnpm dev:browser:cloud` | configured remote application ingress |

## Auth Boundary

Public clients authenticate through SDKWork dual-token headers:
`Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>` and `Access-Token: <access-token>`.

Control-plane routes require `control.read` or `control.write` permissions from AppContext projection.
