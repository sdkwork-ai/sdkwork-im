# CHANGELOG

## v0.2.0 - 2026-07-09

- Loop `90`
- step `projection-consistency-remediation`
- `projection-service` eliminated `40401` read-model miss errors and durable snapshot drift
  - root cause: in-memory projection returned `40401` when a read hit a replica that had not yet consumed the journal event; read paths had no durable-store fallback and the journal consumer swallowed persist failures with a single best-effort `warn!`
  - P0-A: `conversation_summary`, `member_snapshot_for_principal_kind`, `read_cursor_for_principal_kind_and_device` now read-through to durable metadata snapshots on memory miss
  - P0-B: `message_interaction_summary` no longer depends on message-history seq fallback; directly queries durable metadata store
  - P1-A: durable persist now retries up to 3 times with 50/100 ms backoff (`persist_durable_state_with_retry`); worst-case sleep stays below the 250 ms poll interval
  - P1-B: `restore_conversation_snapshot` treats `conversation-summary` as optional; the 2026-07-10 memory-bound follow-up removed startup scope enumeration and now hydrates conversation snapshots through durable read-through on demand
  - P2-A: embedded apply refined for separated cloud deployments — production uses only already-initialized shared runtime (`try_shared_projection_runtime`), separated services silently no-op instead of logging misleading ERROR
  - P2-B: read-through added for `message_visibility_for_principal`, `history_visibility_for_conversation`, `conversation_profile`
- fresh verification:
  - `cargo check -p projection-service` = `passed`
  - `cargo test -p projection-service --lib` = `passed`
- closure:
  - projection read-model consistency remediation is `closed`
  - remaining bounded gap: `message_favorites` and `conversation_preferences` have no durable snapshot yet (require new persistence infrastructure); `contacts`, `client_route_sync`, `inbox`, `member_directory`, receipt summaries have durable snapshots but no read-through (return empty/default on memory miss)

## v0.2.1 - 2026-07-09

- Loop `91`
- step `conversation-creation-persist`
- `comms-conversation-service` fixed `40301 conversation_permission_denied` on RTC session creation for direct chats
  - root cause 1 (missing persist): conversation creation paths (`create_conversation`, `bind_direct_chat`, `create_thread`, `create_agent_dialog`, `create_system_channel`, `create_agent_handoff`) did not call `best_effort_persist_aggregate_state`, so `im_projection_conversation_members` had no member rows after creation. `persist_aggregate_state` reads the in-memory roster, but after LRU eviction `ensure_conversation_loaded` rehydrates from the (empty/partial) relational table instead of journal replay when `db_state.members` is non-empty — a self-reinforcing gap that permanently lost the peer member for direct chats (verified via WSL Ubuntu 22 + PostgreSQL 18: journal had 2 `member_joined` events, relational table had only the anchor row). Role/owner changes (`change_conversation_member_role`, `transfer_conversation_owner`) also missed persist, leaving role/owner columns stale.
  - fix 1: all creation paths now call `best_effort_persist_aggregate_state` before `maybe_evict_after_write` (persist must run while the conversation is still in memory, otherwise `persist_aggregate_state` returns `ConversationNotFound`); the five non-`create_conversation` creation paths also gained the missing `maybe_evict_after_write`. Role/owner change paths now persist after the mutation. Creation persist writes the full roster (anchor + peer for direct chats) so RTC/session-gateway authorization and message search see members immediately.
  - root cause 2 (persist blocked by unique constraint + parse bug): `member_to_record` mapped `member.member_id` (string composite `cm_<conv_id>_<principal_kind>_<principal_id>`) via `parse::<i64>().unwrap_or(0)`, which always returned `0`. The table declared `CONSTRAINT uk_im_projection_conversation_members_member UNIQUE (tenant_id, organization_id, conversation_id, member_id)`, so inserting the second member collided on `member_id=0` and `upsert_member` returned a constraint violation. The first persist fix alone was insufficient — the second member still could not be stored.
  - fix 2: removed the redundant UK constraint from `database/ddl/baseline/postgres/0001_im_baseline.sql` (the composite PK on `(tenant_id, organization_id, conversation_id, principal_kind, principal_id)` is the sole uniqueness guarantee for conversation members, since principal already identifies a member uniquely). Updated `member_to_record` and `cursor_to_record` in `services/sdkwork-comms-conversation-service/src/runtime.rs` to parse `principal_id` (Snowflake i64 for user principals) instead of the string `member_id`, so the stored `member_id` is non-zero and unique per user within a conversation. For non-user principals (agents/system) the value falls back to `0`, which is acceptable because the composite PK remains the sole uniqueness guarantee.
  - historical table registry correction is superseded by `database/contract/table-registry.json`; normalized `im_conversation_members` and `im_conversation_read_cursors` are written by `comms-conversation-service` and no projection service remains.
  - dev DB backfill (one-time data cleanup): WSL Ubuntu 22 + PostgreSQL 18 was used to (a) `ALTER TABLE im_projection_conversation_members DROP CONSTRAINT uk_im_projection_conversation_members_member`, (b) insert missing peer rows for `c_direct_09a8255a1fd3632675c2d355` and `pc-group-24c6420e-fd13-4a85-9fa0-955e23d10e04` from journal `member_joined` events, (c) sync existing rows' `member_id` from `0` to `principal_id::bigint`. Verified final state: 4 rows (anchor + peer per conversation), `member_id` correctly equals `principal_id` for users, `invited_by` populated for peer rows.
  - bounded gap: `persist` is best-effort (`warn!` on failure); a persist failure followed by LRU eviction can still leave a partial table — operational monitoring should alert on the warn log. The `member_id` column remains `bigint` while the in-memory `ConversationMember.member_id` is a string; the new `member_to_record` bridges this by parsing `principal_id`, which is sufficient for user principals (the only kind that RTC authorization and projections rely on). Non-user principals still store `member_id=0`, which is acceptable given the composite PK.
- fresh verification:
  - `cargo check -p sdkwork-comms-conversation-service --lib` = `passed`
  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-comms-conversation-service --lib` = `30 passed`
  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-comms-conversation-service --test conversation_flow_test` = `110 passed` (4 new: direct chat persists both members, create conversation persists creator, change role persists, transfer owner persists)
  - dev DB inspection: `im_projection_conversation_members` has 4 rows (2 per affected conversation), `member_id` equals `principal_id::bigint` for users, `invited_by` populated for peers
- closure: conversation creation persist gap is `closed` for new conversations. Existing dev DB conversations with missing peer rows were backfilled via journal replay. The fix requires a `cargo build` + gateway restart to take effect for new conversations created at runtime; existing conversations already received the one-time backfill.

## v0.0.86 - 2026-04-12

- step `S07`
- `control-plane-api` fixed proactive stale-claim normalization on the shared-channel sync next-write path

  - auto-subscribed root author 会保留 `parentConversationId / rootMessageId / threadRole = root_author` metadata，并初始化默认 read cursor
  - recovery replay 后，root author 仍可在 thread 中发消息；现有 `notification-service` message-posted fanout 无需新增 route，即可消费这条 active member truth

  - `cargo test -p local-minimal-node --offline --test performance_ha_dr_drill_test -- --nocapture`：`5 passed`
- 当前可以诚实宣称 `S13 = step_closure`；但不得宣称真实 `capacity-dedicated` 结果、多 cell / 多 region / object storage DR、完整生产级 SLO/告警自动化已闭环。

## v0.0.23 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`23`
- 执行 step：`S12`

- Loop：`22`
- 影响 step：`S11`
- 在 `services/automation-service/src/lib.rs` 新增 `GET /backend/v3/api/automation/governance`，公开 `capabilityProfileId / enabledCapabilities / guardrailPolicyId / restrictedToolPrefixes / operatorOverridePermission / operatorOverrideActive` 最小治理快照。
- 为 `agent-tool-calls` 引入最小 guardrail：`ops.`、`admin.` 前缀的受限 tool 默认拒绝；无 `automation.operator_override` 时返回 `automation_guardrail_denied`，并写入 `automation.guardrail_denied` 事件；具备 override 时追加 `automation.operator_override_applied` 事件后放行。
- 在 `services/local-minimal-node/src/node/build.rs` 与 `services/local-minimal-node/src/node/platform.rs` 镜像 governance surface，并把 `automation.guardrail_denied / automation.operator_override_applied` 写入 assembled audit anchor。

- 新增 `docs/review/S11-Loop22补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop22补充-2026-04-10.md`，并更新 `docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`，把 `S11` 从 `local_closure` 提升为 `step_closure`。
- 新增 `docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.22-loop-22.md`，固化本轮实现、验证、架构口径与下一轮输入。
- fresh verification：
  - `cargo test -p automation-service --offline test_restricted_tool_call_requires_operator_override_and_is_auditable -- --nocapture`：`1 passed`
  - `cargo test -p automation-service --offline test_automation_governance_surface_and_operator_override_over_http -- --nocapture`：`1 passed`

  - `cargo test -p automation-service --offline --tests`：`17 passed`
  - `cargo test -p local-minimal-node --offline --test task10_capabilities_e2e_test`：`5 passed`
- 结论：`CPR11-3` 已以“静态 guardrail policy + permission-derived operator override + public governance surface + assembled audit anchor”闭环，当前可以诚实标注 `S11 = step_closure`；控制面写入/版本化若要引入，属于后续优化，不再阻塞 `S11`。

## v0.0.21 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`21`
- 影响 step：`S11`

- 在 `services/local-minimal-node/src/node/build.rs` 与 `services/local-minimal-node/src/node/platform.rs` 镜像同一 assembled surface，并新增 `automation.agent_response_started / delta / completed / automation.agent_tool_call_requested / completed` audit anchor 记录。
- 以 TDD 扩展 `services/automation-service/tests/http_smoke_test.rs` 与 `services/local-minimal-node/tests/task10_capabilities_e2e_test.rs`，先得到 `404` 红灯，再转为 HTTP 主链绿灯；同时修正 `AgentSubject` 请求体字段命名与公开返回类型。
- 新增 `docs/review/S11-Loop21补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop21补充-2026-04-10.md`，并更新 `docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`，把 `S11` 当前口径明确为 `local_closure = HTTP lifecycle surface + assembled audit anchors`。
- 新增 `docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.21-loop-21.md`，固化本轮实现、验证、剩余缺口与下一轮输入。

- 结论：`S11` 已不再缺 HTTP 主链，但 `automation guardrail / operator override` 仍未闭环，因此当前只能诚实标注为 `local_closure`，不能宣称 `step_closure`。

## v0.0.20 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`20`
- 影响 step：`S10`
- 新增 `docs/review/S10-执行卡-2026-04-10.md`，正式冻结 `S10` 的目标、非目标、写集、CPR 与证据口径，纠正此前“只有准入判断、没有执行卡”的治理缺口。
- 基于 fresh verification 重新审计 `streaming-service`、`im-call-runtime`、`media-service` 与 `local-minimal-node` 的 assembled 路径，确认当前仓库已具备 `CPR10-1/2/3` 的真实闭环，无需再补一个伪需求代码切片。
- 新增 `docs/review/S10-质量审计与复盘-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/review/S10-架构兑现与回写决议-2026-04-10.md`，并更新 `docs/review/S10-准入判断-2026-04-10.md`，把 `S10` 从“可准入”提升为 `step_closure`。

## v0.0.19 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`19`
- 影响 step：`S09`、`S10`
- 在 `crates/im-domain-core/src/conversation.rs` 收紧 `ConversationPolicy::normalize()`：仅允许 `joined / world_readable`，并对 `invited/shared` 返回显式 unsupported，终止“已发布但未实现”的 history visibility 漂移。
- 在 `crates/sdkwork-im-ccp-registry/src/lib.rs` 把 `businessPolicyVocabulary.historyVisibilityModes` 收敛为 `joined / world_readable`，使 registry、control-plane、runtime 对外口径一致。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/policy.rs` 移除 `invited/shared` 的隐式活跃成员语义；若 runtime 读路径遇到 legacy 快照，返回显式 unsupported，而不是继续伪装成受支持模式。
- 以 TDD 扩展 `crates/im-domain-core/tests/conversation_domain_builder_test.rs`、`crates/sdkwork-im-ccp-registry/tests/governance_snapshot_test.rs`、`services/control-plane-api/tests/protocol_governance_test.rs`、`services/conversation-runtime/tests/http_smoke_test.rs`，先证明 domain/registry/control-plane/runtime 都在错误接受或发布未实现模式，再保持通过。
- 更新 `docs/review/S09-*`、`docs/review/S10-准入判断-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop19补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.19-loop-19.md`，把 `S09` 正式提升为 `step_closure`，并解除 `S10` 准入阻塞。
- fresh verification：

  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-im-ccp-registry --offline`：`passed`
  - `cargo test -p im-platform-contracts --offline`：`passed`
- 结论：`S09` 已完成“published policy vocabulary == real runtime support”闭环；`S10` 现已具备真实准入条件，未来若要重新发布 `invited/shared`，必须先完成对应 durable truth。

## v0.0.18 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`18`
- 影响 step：`S09`、`S10`
- 在 `crates/im-domain-core/src/message.rs` 为 `StoredMessagePin / StoredMessage` 补齐 serde，并新增 `ConversationMessageLog::messages_in_order()`，使最小历史消息快照可直接作为 runtime 读结果输出。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime.rs`、`services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/membership.rs` 新增 `MessageHistoryResult`、`list_messages_from_auth_context`、`list_messages`，把历史读取收口到 runtime auth-context 边界。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/http.rs` 为 `/im/v3/api/chat/conversations/{conversationId}/messages` 增加 `GET`，形成最小稳定历史消息读取面。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/policy.rs` 新增 `ensure_history_read_allowed`，让 `history_visibility` 首次真实影响读路径：`joined` 非成员 `403`，`world_readable` 同租户已鉴权非成员 `200`。
- 以 TDD 扩展 `services/conversation-runtime/tests/conversation_domain_structure_test.rs` 与 `services/conversation-runtime/tests/http_smoke_test.rs`，锁定 runtime read-query auth-context 收口和 `joined/world_readable` 行为差异。
- 更新 `docs/review/S09-*`、`docs/review/S10-准入判断-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop18补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.18-loop-18.md`，把 Loop-18 的真实读路径策略消费回写为 as-built。
- fresh verification：
  - `cargo test -p im-domain-core --offline`：`passed`
  - `cargo test -p conversation-runtime --offline --tests`：`passed`
  - `cargo test -p control-plane-api --offline --tests`：`passed`
  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-im-ccp-registry --offline`：`passed`
  - `cargo test -p im-platform-contracts --offline`：`passed`
- 结论：`S09` 获得更强的 `local_closure = runtime history visibility partial read consumption`，但 `invited/shared` 仍折叠为活跃成员读取语义，`retention_policy_ref` 仍归 `S13` owner，因此 `S10` 继续阻塞。

## v0.0.17 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：`17`
- 影响 step：`S09`、`S10`
- 在 `crates/im-domain-core/src/conversation.rs` 新增 `ConversationPolicy`、`policy_epoch` 与 capability 判定，使业务策略快照进入 conversation 聚合真相，而不再只停留在 control-plane 发布层。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/governance.rs`、`recovery.rs`、`support.rs` 新增独立事件 `conversation.policy_applied` 及 replay 恢复逻辑，把策略事实从 `conversation.created` 分离出来，形成更清晰的 DDD 治理边界。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/http.rs` 让 `POST /im/v3/api/chat/conversations` 支持 `policyVersion / capabilityFlags / historyVisibility / retentionPolicyRef`，并在建会后立即绑定策略。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/policy.rs` 让 `capability_flags` 开始真实约束 `message.reaction` 与 `message.pin`，使 `S09` 首次从“词汇发布”推进到“runtime 消费”。
- 以 TDD 扩展 `services/conversation-runtime/tests/conversation_flow_test.rs` 与 `services/conversation-runtime/tests/http_smoke_test.rs`，补齐 replay 与 HTTP mainline 证据。
- 更新 `docs/review/S09-*`、`docs/review/S10-准入判断-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop17补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.17-loop-17.md`，把 Loop-17 的真实边界回写为 as-built。
- fresh verification：
  - `cargo test -p im-domain-core --offline`：`32 passed`
  - `cargo test -p conversation-runtime --offline --tests`：`113 passed`
  - `cargo test -p control-plane-api --offline --tests`：`40 passed`
  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-im-ccp-registry --offline`：`2 passed`
  - `cargo test -p im-platform-contracts --offline`：`16 passed`
- 结论：`S09` 获得更强的 `local_closure = runtime capability policy consumption`，但 `history_visibility` 尚无读路径、`retention_policy_ref` 尚无 owner 闭环，故仍不是 `step_closure`；`S10` 继续阻塞。

- 在 `services/control-plane-api/src/lib.rs` 为 `/backend/v3/api/control/protocol-governance` 新增 `businessPolicyVocabulary` 输出，使协议治理快照对 control-plane reader 与后续 SDK facade 可直接消费，不再只停留在架构文档口径。
- 以 TDD 扩展 `crates/sdkwork-im-ccp-registry/tests/governance_snapshot_test.rs`、`services/control-plane-api/tests/protocol_governance_test.rs`，先得到缺字段红灯，再转协议快照与 JSON surface 绿灯。
- 更新 `docs/review/S09-*`、`docs/架构/152CJ-current-architecture-as-built-alignment-2026-04-09.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop16补充-2026-04-10.md`、`sdks/README.md`、`sdks/sdkwork-im-sdk/README.md`、`sdks/sdkwork-control-plane-sdk/README.md`、`docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.16-loop-16.md`，把 `S09` 的协议词汇发布面回写为当前 as-built。

  - `cargo test -p sdkwork-im-ccp-registry --offline`：`2 passed`
  - `cargo test -p im-platform-contracts --offline`：`16 passed`
- 结论：`S09` 获得 `local_closure = protocol business policy vocabulary publication`，但 `step_closure` 仍待 runtime/business model 对齐；`S10` 继续被 `S09` 阻塞。

- Loop：`15`
- 影响 step：`S08`、`S10`
- 在 `services/projection-service` 新增 `reaction/pin summary` 派生面：`src/interactions.rs` 按 `message.reaction_added`、`message.reaction_removed`、`message.pin_added`、`message.pin_removed` 维护 `MessageInteractionSummaryView / pinned_messages`
- 补齐 `src/http.rs`、`src/access.rs`、`src/snapshot.rs`、`src/scope.rs` 与 `src/lib.rs` 装配，使 `interaction-summary`、`pins`、snapshot restore、client-route sync fanout 全部进入同一投影闭环
- 以 TDD 扩展 `timeline_projection_test.rs`、`http_smoke_test.rs`、`projection_snapshot_test.rs`、`lib_structure_test.rs`，锁定 interaction summary、pins query、snapshot restore 与 `lib.rs` 红线
- 更新 `docs/review/S08-Loop15补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/review/S10-Loop15补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/架构/152CJ-Loop15补充-2026-04-10.md`、`docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.15-loop-15.md`，并修正 `152CJ` 主文中过期的“缺 reaction/pin summary”断言

- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime.rs` 新增 `AddMessageReactionCommand`、`RemoveMessageReactionCommand`、`PinMessageCommand`、`UnpinMessageCommand` 及对应结果模型、鉴权构造器与运行时入口，统一收口 message-level mutation。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/policy.rs` 新增 reaction/pin 权限校验：reaction 维持活跃成员可操作，pin 限制为群 owner/admin、直聊 owner。
- 在 `services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/support.rs`、`services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/recovery.rs`、`services/conversation-runtime/src/runtime/http.rs` 补齐 `message.reaction_added`、`message.reaction_removed`、`message.pin_added`、`message.pin_removed` 的 envelope、replay 与 HTTP surface。

- 新增 `docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.5-loop-05.md`，固化本轮准入判断、阻塞项、评分与下一轮输入。

## v0.0.4 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：04
- 影响 step：`S09`
- 新增 `docs/review/S09-质量审计与复盘-2026-04-10.md`，把 `S09` 的 fresh tests、剩余风险和下一步收口路径沉淀为正式质量结论。
- 新增 `docs/review/S09-架构兑现与回写决议-2026-04-10.md`，明确当前实现仍在 `152CJ` 的 as-built 边界内，无需回写主架构文档。
- 更新 `docs/review/S09-执行卡-2026-04-10.md`，把 `Q6` 从缺少 review 支撑推进为 `yes`，并把未闭环原因收敛到 `Q1` 与 `S10` 准入联判。

## v0.0.3 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：03
- 影响 step：`S09`、`S14`
- fresh 执行 `cargo test -p sdkwork-im-ccp-registry --offline` 与 `cargo test -p im-platform-contracts --offline`，确认 `S09` 的 registry / contract / provider policy 基线具备可执行证据。
- 在 `services/control-plane-api/tests/protocol_governance_test.rs` 新增 `protocolGovernancePath` 断言，锁定 `sdkCompatibilityBaseline` 的控制面治理路径。
- 更新 `sdks/README.md`、`sdks/sdkwork-im-sdk/README.md`、`sdks/sdkwork-control-plane-sdk/README.md`，使 SDK 文档与 `sdkCompatibilityBaseline` 的 facade、registry、governance、matrix 口径完全一致。

## v0.0.2 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：02
- 影响 step：`S00`、`S09`、`S14`
- 新增 `docs/review/S09-执行卡-2026-04-10.md`，把当前协议治理 / registry / provider baseline 实现波次正式接入新 `Sxx` 执行体系。
- 更新 `docs/review/README.md`，明确新 `Sxx` 执行卡与历史 `step-XX` 执行卡的并存规则。
- 新增 `docs/release/2026-04-10-v0.0.2-loop-02.md`，固定本轮状态、缺口分级、评分基线与下一轮验证入口。
- fresh 执行 `cargo test -p control-plane-api --offline --tests` 通过，确认当前 `S09` 控制面协议 / 治理 / provider surface 具备可执行基线。

## v0.0.1 - 2026-04-10

- Loop：01
- 影响 step：`S00`、`S14`
- 建立 `docs/release` 目录、changelog 规则与版本化 loop 文档机制。
- 重写循环执行提示词，使其对齐 `S00-S14`、`100-*`、`101-*`、`95`、`97`。
- 固化“先批量实现、后逐 step 测试收口、每轮强制更新 changelog”的执行协议。
