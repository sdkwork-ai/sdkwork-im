# sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway-config

Domain: communication
Capability: chat
Package type: rust-crate
Status: standardizing

This README is the SDKWork module entrypoint for `sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway-config`. The machine-readable component contract is `specs/component.spec.json`; canonical standards are under `../../../sdkwork-specs/`.

## Public API

- `.`

## Required SDK Surface

- None declared in `specs/component.spec.json`.

## Configuration

Configuration keys, runtime entrypoints, and integration contracts are declared in `specs/component.spec.json`. Shared modules must receive configuration through typed bootstrap or service boundaries rather than reading host-local environment state directly.

Foundation traffic uses one `sdkwork-api-cloud-gateway` root.
`SDKWORK_IM_PLATFORM_API_GATEWAY_HTTP_URL` and `SDKWORK_API_CLOUD_GATEWAY_BASE_URL` select that root;
`SDKWORK_API_CLOUD_GATEWAY_BIND` derives a local `http://<bind>` root when no URL is set. Application
ingress bind uses `SDKWORK_IM_APPLICATION_PUBLIC_INGRESS_BIND`. Per-module foundation upstream and
base URL overrides are retired; the platform gateway mounts selected capabilities through Cargo
assembly features.

## SaaS/Private/Local Behavior

This component follows the deployment and runtime rules referenced by its `canonicalSpecs` entries. SaaS, private, and local behavior must stay compatible with the relevant SDKWork specs before implementation changes are made.

## Security

Do not add secrets, live tokens, manual auth headers, or app-local credential handling to this module. Protected API and SDK access must use the generated SDK or approved service boundary declared in the component contract.

## Extension Points

Extension points are limited to public exports, runtime entrypoints, SDK clients, events, and config keys declared in `specs/component.spec.json`.

## Verification

- `cargo test --manifest-path apps/sdkwork-im/crates/sdkwork-im-cloud-gateway-config/Cargo.toml`

## Owner And Status

Owner and lifecycle status are tracked in `specs/component.spec.json`. Update that contract before changing public integration behavior.
